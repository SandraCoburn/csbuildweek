## Describing Your Code in an Interview

## Some techniques for relaxing during the interview.

    - Pretend you already have the job and the interviewer is a coworker who came to you for hel on a difficult problem
        - If you already had the job, there is no stress
        - Reframes the situation from an interview to just problem-solving
        - Puts you in a cooperative mindset
        - If forces you to *teach* the problem and solution

## UPER is the key to it all

- Understand
  - Ask questions about the problem
  - Dialog between you and interviewer
  - Repharase the problem back to the interviewer in your own words
- Plan
  - Come up with multiple plans, if possible
  - Don't ignore the naive plan
  - Teach the plan to the interviewer
  - Think in big concepts
- Execute
  - If you are describing your existing code:
   - Interviewer will look for where the concepts match the blocks of code
   - Point out interesting things in it
- Reflect
  - What could we have done better?
  - Future directions and features
  - If you made any mistakes, point them out with solutions.
